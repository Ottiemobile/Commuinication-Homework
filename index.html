                not only gain things such as exchange in information, ideas, news, and feelings, but they also create and 
                share meaning. Basically, communication is a way to connect to people or places. In business scenarios, it is used as a function of 
                management. Orginization cannot be operational without the use of communication between levels, organizations, and employees on a 
                daily basis.
